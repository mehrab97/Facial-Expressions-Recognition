# Facial-Expressions-Recognition
Worked on the muxspace/facial_expressions GitHub repository consisting of eight different facial expressions - anger, surprise, disgust, fear, neutral, happiness, sadness and contempt. Created a dictionary with keys as the expression names and values as a list of images related to that expression
Performed data augmentation using Kerasâ€™ ImageDataGenerator. Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify each face based on the facial expression in the image to one of the eight possible categories
